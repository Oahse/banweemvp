Please disregard my previous, poorly formatted instructions.

To correctly diagnose the frontend issue, please perform the following in your web browser:

1.  **Open Developer Tools:** Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` in your browser. Open the developer tools (usually by pressing F12, or right-clicking on the page and selecting 'Inspect').

2.  **Network Tab Inspection:** Go to the 'Network' tab within the developer tools. Refresh the page (`Ctrl+R` or `Cmd+R`).
    *   Look for any requests that show a '404 Not Found' status or other error.
    *   **What are the *full URLs* of these requests?** Please provide them.

3.  **Console Tab Inspection:** Go to the 'Console' tab.
    *   **Are there any red-colored JavaScript errors?** If so, please provide them.
    *   In the console, type `import.meta.env` (exactly as written) and press Enter.
    *   **What is the output of `import.meta.env`?** This will show the environment variables your frontend application is actually using.

Your detailed observations of these three points are crucial for the next steps.
